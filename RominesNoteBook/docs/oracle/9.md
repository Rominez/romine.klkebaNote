# 2 Compatibility, Upgrading, Downgrading, and Installation

---

#### Caution:
After installation is complete, do not manually remove or run `cron` jobs that remove `/tmp/.oracle` or `/var/tmp/.oracle` directories or their files while Oracle software is running. If you remove these files, then Oracle software can encounter intermittent hangs. Oracle grid infrastructure for a cluster and Oracle Restart installations fail with the following error:

`CRS-0184: Cannot communicate with the CRS daemon.`
