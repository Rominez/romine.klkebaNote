#  B.  Making and Installing the Subversion Apache Server Module


Go back into your subversion working copy and run `./autogen.sh` if
you need to.  Then, assuming Apache httpd 2.2 is installed in the
standard location, run:

```
$ ./configure
```

Note: do *not* configure subversion with `--disable-shared`!
mod_dav_svn *must* be built as a shared library, and it will
look for other `libsvn_*.so` libraries on your system.

If you see a warning message that the build of mod_dav_svn is
being skipped, this may be because you have Apache httpd 2.x
installed in a non-standard location.  You can use the
`--with-apxs=` option to locate the apxs script:

```
$ ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs
```

Note: it *is* possible to build mod_dav_svn as a static library
and link it directly into Apache. Possible, but painful. Stick
with the shared library for now; if you can't, then ask.

```
$ rm /usr/local/lib/libsvn*
```

If you have old subversion libraries sitting on your system,
libtool will link them instead of the 'fresh' ones in your tree.
Remove them before building subversion.

```
$ make clean && make && make install
```

After the make install, the Subversion shared libraries are in
`/usr/local/lib/`.  `mod_dav_svn.so` should be installed in
`/usr/local/libexec/` (or elsewhere, such as `/usr/local/apache2/modules/`,
if you passed `--with-apache-libexecdir` to configure).


Section II.E explains how to build the server on Windows.
