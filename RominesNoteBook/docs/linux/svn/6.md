# D.  Running and Testing

Fire up apache 2:

```
$ /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl stop
$ /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start
```

Check /usr/local/apache2/logs/error_log to make sure it started
up okay.

Try doing a network checkout from the repository:

```
$ svn co http://localhost/svn/repos wc
```

The most common reason this might fail is permission problems
reading the repository db files.  If the checkout fails, make
sure that the httpd process has permission to read and write to
the repository.  You can see all of mod_dav_svn's complaints`投诉` in
the Apache error logfile, /usr/local/apache2/logs/error_log.

To run the regression test suite`回归测试套件` for networked Subversion, see
the instructions`指令` in `subversion/tests/cmdline/README`.
For advice about tracing problems, see ["Debugging the server"](https://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/).
