# E.  Alternative:  'svnserve' and ra_svn

An alternative`替代` network layer is libsvn_ra_svn (on the client
side) and the 'svnserve' process on the server.  This is a
simple network layer that speaks a custom protocol over plain
TCP`在普通TCP上使用自定义协议` (documented in libsvn_ra_svn/protocol):

```
$ svnserve -d     # becomes a background daemon
$ svn checkout svn://localhost/usr/local/svn/repository
```

You can use the "-r" option to svnserve to set a logical root
for repositories, and the "-R" option to restrict`限制` connections to
read-only access.  ("Read-only" is a logical term here; svnserve
still needs write access to the database in this mode, but will
not allow commits or revprop changes.)

'svnserve' has built-in CRAM-MD5 authentication (so you can use
non-system accounts), and can also be tunneled over SSH (so you
can use existing system accounts).  It's also capable of using
Cyrus SASL if libsasl2 is detected at ./configure time.  Please
read chapter 6 in the Subversion Book
(http://svnbook.red-bean.com) for details on these features.
